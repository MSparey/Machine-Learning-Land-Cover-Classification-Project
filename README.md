# Machine-Learning-Land-Cover-Classification-Project
Project to train a machine learning algorithm to be able to classify regions into land cover classifications based on available climate data.
As a continuation of the Whittaker classification project, we seek to determine surface land cover classification based on availible data that is also modelable for future predictions.
